📌 Format suggestion:

Each session = 15–20 minutes of overview, 20–30 minutes of case studies/examples, 10–15 minutes of open discussion/Q&A.

Optional: invite guest speakers (consultants, technologists, artists experimenting with AI).

This structure should leave your friend feeling not like a coder, but like a strategic AI-literate leader, able to guide conversations with consultants, advise boards, and spot opportunities.

Would you like me to expand this into a reading + case study list for each session (so he knows what to review before discussions), or would you prefer a more presentation-friendly syllabus he could use with peers and board members?

You said:
yes - reading & case study list for each session, and/or reference youtube videos if there is something particularly excellent. Please put each session in its own document.

Got it 👍 — I’ll prepare a 20-document syllabus set, one per session. Each will include:

A session overview (summary of what he’ll learn).

Recommended readings (short, accessible articles, reports, or book excerpts).

Case studies/examples (especially from arts, nonprofits, and business).

Optional video resources (curated YouTube/TED talks, not technical lectures).

This way, he can treat each document as a standalone one-hour seminar guide.

ALSO - List the readings for reference, but they may not be available. So please write an essay that incorporates information and perspectives from those readings? the essay should be long and detailed enough that it takes 15 - 20 minutes to read.
