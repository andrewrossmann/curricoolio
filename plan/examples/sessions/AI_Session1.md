Ai Plain English

Artificial Intelligence in Plain English: An Essay for Business and Arts Leaders

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most discussed, admired, and feared technological developments of our time. Yet, for many seasoned leaders outside of technology, the concept of AI can still feel abstract, overly technical, or shrouded in hype. This essay aims to bring AI into plain language‚Äîdrawing on perspectives from business analysis, academic commentary, and cultural application‚Äîto help business and arts leaders understand what AI is, why it matters, and how it is reshaping both commerce and culture. The goal is not to turn the reader into a technologist, but to enable them to speak fluently about AI in boardrooms, strategy sessions, and conversations about the future of their organizations.

What is Artificial Intelligence?

At its simplest, AI refers to computer systems that perform tasks which, if carried out by humans, would be considered to require intelligence. This includes tasks like recognizing speech, translating languages, analyzing patterns in data, or creating new images, music, and text. Unlike traditional software, which follows a set of hard-coded rules, AI systems learn from large volumes of data. They improve by finding patterns rather than relying exclusively on instructions written by a programmer.

The term AI itself has been around since the 1950s. Early AI systems were narrow and brittle, capable of handling well-defined problems like playing chess or solving math puzzles. Over the decades, AI research experienced several ‚Äúbooms and winters,‚Äù moments when optimism surged and then collapsed under unmet expectations. What has changed in the last decade‚Äîand why we are talking about AI in a way we never did before‚Äîis the emergence of machine learning techniques, vast computational power, and oceans of digital data that together make AI systems startlingly capable.

The Rise of Generative AI

One of the most dramatic developments is generative AI. Unlike earlier AI systems that classified data or made predictions, generative AI creates new content: text that reads fluidly, images that look as though painted by an artist, music composed in any genre, or even synthetic video. Tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and DALL¬∑E have captured public imagination because they demonstrate an uncanny ability to mimic human creativity. For a business leader, the rise of generative AI signals both an opportunity to scale creative tasks and a need to think carefully about intellectual property, authenticity, and artistic integrity.

This shift has been compared to the arrival of electricity: a general-purpose technology that quietly but radically reshaped every industry. Just as electricity powered factories, homes, and cultural institutions in unforeseen ways, generative AI is poised to influence not only how we work but also how we imagine, communicate, and tell stories.

How AI Differs from Traditional Software

To appreciate why AI is so disruptive, it helps to distinguish it from traditional computing. Conventional software is built on explicit rules: ‚ÄúIf X happens, then do Y.‚Äù For example, a payroll system processes salaries by following coded instructions. By contrast, AI does not rely on such step-by-step rules. Instead, it is trained on large datasets‚Äîwhether millions of images, billions of words, or troves of medical scans‚Äîand learns statistical relationships. As a result, AI can perform tasks programmers could never anticipate in detail.

This flexibility also creates unpredictability. AI systems may generate ‚Äúhallucinations,‚Äù outputs that are plausible but incorrect. They may contain biases present in their training data. They do not possess human judgment, common sense, or ethical reasoning. This makes them powerful collaborators but poor substitutes for decision-makers.

Everyday Encounters with AI

Even if one has never consciously engaged with AI, it has already become woven into daily life:

Search engines use AI to rank results.

Streaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify use recommendation algorithms.

E-commerce sites rely on AI to personalize shopping suggestions.

Smartphones use facial recognition, autocorrect, and digital assistants.

In each of these cases, the AI is largely invisible. Generative AI, however, has brought the technology into direct interaction with the public. Typing a question into ChatGPT or asking an AI to generate a new ballet poster makes the technology tangible in a way recommendation engines never did.

AI in the Arts and Cultural Institutions

For cultural organizations, the relevance of AI goes beyond mere productivity. Museums are using AI to catalog and preserve collections, to power interactive exhibits, and to broaden accessibility by offering real-time translation or AI-generated audio descriptions. Ballet companies experiment with AI-assisted choreography. Digital artists use generative AI as a new brush, creating hybrid works that combine human imagination with algorithmic creativity.

Yet, this raises vital questions: What does authorship mean when a machine helps generate the final work? How do institutions value and present AI-assisted art? Leaders in the arts must prepare for audiences who increasingly expect interactive, AI-enhanced experiences while also ensuring that human creativity and cultural authenticity remain central.

AI in Business Operations

From a business standpoint, AI is often seen as a tool for efficiency. In operations, AI can forecast demand, optimize logistics, and detect fraud. In fundraising and donor engagement, AI can segment audiences, tailor communications, and even draft personalized thank-you notes. These applications promise to free up human staff to focus on strategy, relationship-building, and creativity‚Äîareas where machines still fall short.

However, successful adoption requires more than enthusiasm. Leaders must ask: Where does AI genuinely add value? Where are the risks of over-automation? How do we maintain transparency and accountability when AI influences decisions about people and money?

Ethical and Strategic Considerations

Ethical considerations loom large. Because AI is trained on past data, it can reproduce and amplify biases. For nonprofits and cultural organizations that pride themselves on inclusivity, this poses a reputational and moral hazard. Similarly, AI‚Äôs use of vast datasets raises questions about privacy and ownership, particularly in contexts where donor or visitor data is involved.

Strategically, boards and executives must also consider the broader shifts AI is causing in the economy and society. Jobs will change, new roles will emerge, and expectations for services and experiences will evolve. Leaders who understand AI will be better positioned to guide their organizations through these transitions rather than simply reacting to them.

The Role of Leaders and Boards

For businesspeople and trustees of cultural institutions, the most important skill is not coding but AI literacy. This means understanding AI‚Äôs possibilities, its limits, and its implications for governance. Boards should be asking:

How is management evaluating potential AI applications?

What safeguards are in place for ethical use?

How are staff and stakeholders being educated about AI?

What new partnerships might AI make possible?

AI literacy also involves cultivating a mindset of curiosity and adaptability. Just as leaders in the late 1990s had to understand the Internet‚Äôs impact on commerce and culture, today‚Äôs leaders must learn enough about AI to make informed, strategic decisions.

Looking Forward

AI is not a passing fad; it is a structural shift in how technology operates and how culture evolves. We are in the early chapters of its story. Already, AI has shown promise in expanding access to information, unleashing new creative possibilities, and streamlining complex operations. At the same time, it brings challenges of bias, misinformation, intellectual property disputes, and human displacement.

The leaders who thrive in this new landscape will be those who embrace AI as a partner, not a replacement; who recognize its capacity to amplify human creativity rather than diminish it; and who ensure that cultural values guide its use. For trustees, fundraisers, and executives, AI is not primarily about engineering‚Äîit is about stewardship, imagination, and responsibility.

Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence, explained in plain language, is the science of creating machines that can perform tasks we associate with human intelligence. It differs from past software because it learns from data rather than simply executing rules. It shows up in our daily lives through invisible services like recommendation engines and visible innovations like generative AI tools. It offers cultural institutions new ways to engage audiences, and it offers businesses new ways to operate efficiently. But it also brings ethical and strategic challenges that demand literacy from leaders.

Ultimately, AI is not the story of machines replacing people. It is the story of how people choose to shape technology to enhance, complement, and extend human endeavor. For cultural leaders and business professionals, the challenge is to understand AI well enough to guide its use responsibly and creatively‚Äîensuring that it serves not only profit but also culture, community, and human flourishing.
