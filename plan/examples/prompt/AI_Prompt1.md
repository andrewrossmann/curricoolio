My friend is a seasoned businessman, and a fundraiser for the arts. He sits on the boards of several museums, the ballet, and other cultural organizations. He does not write code and is more comfortable employing technical consultants rather than creating technology himself. 

He uses chatgpt to ask questions, but that is as far as he has gotten with ai. He feels like he is falling behind everyone else! 

He would like a syllabus of all ai topics you think would be of interest to someone like him, broken down into 20 sections, each roughly one hour in length (although some topics may require more than one session to complete).

What would you suggest?
