# AI Syllabus for Cultural and Business Leaders (20 Sessions)

Here‚Äôs a 20-session AI literacy and strategy syllabus tailored for a seasoned business and arts leader like your friend. 
It‚Äôs designed to give him breadth (what AI is, what it can do, what risks exist) and depth (how it reshapes fundraising, 
governance, and culture), without requiring him to code. Each session is ~1 hour, with some involving discussion, case studies, 
or light demonstrations rather than technical work.

üìå **Format suggestion:**  
Each session = 15‚Äì20 minutes of overview, 20‚Äì30 minutes of case studies/examples, 10‚Äì15 minutes of open discussion/Q&A.

Optional: invite guest speakers (consultants, technologists, artists experimenting with AI).

This structure should leave your friend feeling not like a coder, but like a strategic AI-literate leader, able to guide conversations 
with consultants, advise boards, and spot opportunities.

reading & case study list for each session, and/or reference youtube videos if there is something particularly excellent. Please put each session in its own document.
Got it üëç ‚Äî I‚Äôll prepare a 20-document syllabus set, one per session. Each will include:

A session overview (summary of what he‚Äôll learn).

Recommended readings (short, accessible articles, reports, or book excerpts).

Case studies/examples (especially from arts, nonprofits, and business).

Optional video resources (curated YouTube/TED talks, not technical lectures).

This way, he can treat each document as a standalone one-hour seminar guide.
